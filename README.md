### Notes
Contains bugs: An educational project only    
The area to check is calculated by find the N,E,S,W most points from the user-provided points. This can lead to anomalous results at times.
A more accurate method would be to generate a new Area between each pair of points. This method was not chosen as it would require a call to the Bing Maps API for every pair of points, which leads to concerns about the app being blocked by the API, and long wait times while loading traffic data.
